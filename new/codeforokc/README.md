# New codeforokc.org Web Site

This is the folder for the next iteration of codeforokc.org. For now, we have decided to use Jekyll to build the static site.

## Quick-start Guide

1. Install Ruby v2.0 or greater.

1. `cd` into this directory and install the dependencies:

    ```
    $ bundle install
    ```

1. Build and serve the Jekyll site:

    ```
    $ jekyll serve
    ```

You can now browse to http://localhost:4000 to view the site.
